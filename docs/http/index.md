# SpacetimeDB HTTP Authorization

Rather than a password, each Spacetime identity is associated with a private token. These tokens are generated by SpacetimeDB when the corresponding identity is created, and cannot be changed.

> Do not share your SpacetimeDB token with anyone, ever.

### Generating identities and tokens

Clients can request a new identity and token via [the `POST /v1/identity` HTTP endpoint](/docs/http/identity#post-v1identity).

Alternately, a new identity and token will be generated during an anonymous connection via the WebSocket API, and passed to the client as an `IdentityToken` message.

### `Authorization` headers

Many SpacetimeDB HTTP endpoints either require or optionally accept a token in the `Authorization` header. SpacetimeDB authorization headers are of the form `Authorization: Bearer ${token}`.

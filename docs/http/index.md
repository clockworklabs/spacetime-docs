# SpacetimeDB HTTP Authorization

Rather than a password, each Spacetime identity is associated with a private token. These tokens are generated by SpacetimeDB when the corresponding identity is created, and cannot be changed.

> Do not share your SpacetimeDB token with anyone, ever.

### Generating identities and tokens

Clients can request a new identity and token via [the `/identity POST` HTTP endpoint](/docs/http/identity#identity-post).

Alternately, a new identity and token will be generated during an anonymous connection via the [WebSocket API](/docs/ws), and passed to the client as [an `IdentityToken` message](/docs/ws#identitytoken).

### Encoding `Authorization` headers

Many SpacetimeDB HTTP endpoints either require or optionally accept a token in the `Authorization` header. SpacetimeDB authorization headers use `Basic` authorization with the username `token` and the token as the password. Because Spacetime tokens are not passwords, and SpacetimeDB Cloud uses TLS, usual security concerns about HTTP `Basic` authorization do not apply.

To construct an appropriate `Authorization` header value for a `token`:

1. Prepend the string `token:`.
2. Base64-encode.
3. Prepend the string `Basic `.

#### Rust

```rust
fn auth_header_value(token: &str) -> String {
    let username_and_password = format!("token:{}", token);
    let base64_encoded = base64::prelude::BASE64_STANDARD.encode(username_and_password);
    format!("Basic {}", encoded)
}
```

#### C#

```csharp
public string AuthHeaderValue(string token)
{
    var username_and_password = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($"token:{auth}");
    var base64_encoded = Convert.ToBase64String(username_and_password);
    return "Basic " + base64_encoded;
}
```

The objective of this progressive tutorial is to help you become acquainted with the basic features of SpacetimeDB. By the end, you should have a basic understanding of what SpacetimeDB offers for developers making multiplayer games. It assumes that you have a basic understanding of the Unity Editor, Git, using a commandline terminal and coding.

We'll give you some CLI commands to execute. If you are using Windows, we recommend using Git Bash or PowerShell. For Mac, we recommend Terminal.

Tested with Unity `2022.3.20 LTS` (and may also work on newer versions). We'll be opening .cs files in an IDE like _Visual Studio_ or _Rider_.

## Unity Tutorial - Basic Multiplayer
Get started with the core client-server setup. For part 2, you may choose your server module preference of [Rust](/docs/modules/rust) or [C#](/docs/modules/c-sharp):

1. [Setup](/docs/unity/part-1.md)
2. [Server (C#)](/docs/unity/part-2.md) â˜¼
3. [Client (Unity)](/docs/unity/part-3.md)

â˜¼ While the tutorial uses C#, the repo cloned in [Part 1](/docs/unity/part-1.md) does include a legacy Rust example to optionally use, instead.

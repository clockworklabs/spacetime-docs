Need help with the tutorial or CLI commands? [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/spacetimedb)!

The objective of this progressive tutorial is to help you become acquainted with the basic features of SpacetimeDB. By the end, you should have a basic understanding of what SpacetimeDB offers for developers making multiplayer games. It assumes that you have a basic understanding of the Unity Editor, using a command line terminal and coding.

We'll give you some CLI commands to execute. If you are using Windows, we recommend using Git Bash or PowerShell. For Mac, we recommend Terminal.

Tested with UnityEngine `2022.3.20f1 LTS` (and may also work on newer versions).

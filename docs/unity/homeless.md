### Create the Module

1. It is important that you already have the SpacetimeDB CLI tool [installed](/install).

2. Run SpacetimeDB locally using the installed CLI. In a **new** terminal or command window, run the following command:

```bash
spacetime start
```

ðŸ’¡ Standalone mode will run in the foreground.
ðŸ’¡ Below examples Rust language, [but you may also use C#](../modules/c-sharp/index.md).
